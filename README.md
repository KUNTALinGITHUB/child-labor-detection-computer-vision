## Abstract
This paper presents a multi-stage real-time computer vision system for detecting potential child labor in hazardous industrial environments such as construction sites, industrial areas, and workshops. The system integrates scene classification (ResNet50), object and PPE detection (YOLO), face detection, demographic age estimation (FairFace), and pose-based work activity recognition to enable proactive monitoring and real-time alerts.
